# TicTacToe-
My game of TicTacToe, which I built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

This is my very first side project, which allowed me to gain significant insight into the DOM and in particular, how to properly utlise Event Listeners. 

I struggled immensely in the beginning, largely due to my lack of knowledge of how to plan and design programs. I built complex features too fast based on too many assumptions, when I should have iterated via gradual testing. 

I also struggled working with closures and loops, as well as getting Event Listeners to work with loops, however in the end I realised that it was all about maintaining simplicity and going back to the basics. 

I specifically remember the moment I got this game working, because I was on the bus and as I was coding, things didn't seem quite right. In fact, what had happened is that I was so absorbed into my coding that I had missed five stops and as a result, was late to work.
